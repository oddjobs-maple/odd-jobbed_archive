# odd-jobbed archive

An archive of media (focusing particularly on text, and some images, but also
selectively including video/audio) relating to MapleStory odd jobs. The data
here is used to render the corresponding &ldquo;Archive&rdquo; page on [the
Oddjobs website](https://oddjobs.codeberg.page/).

If we lived in such a silly world that there were such a thing as Maple
historians and Maple archaeologists, this archive would be to aid them.
